### New action types for geolocation

There are 2 Location actions:
1. Get Location
2. Show Location

<br/>

### Get Location:
Gives userâ€™s current device location or opens a location picker and returns the location chosen by the user. In the browser it uses Bing Maps as the mapping interface.

<br/>

The ACE action for Get Location is: `VivaAction.GetLocation`. <br/>
It takes an optional boolean parameter: `ChooseLocationOnMap`.

If the property `ChooseLocationOnMap` is set to `true`, then the action will open a map, and user will get to choose a location on the map, otherwise, it will give user's current device location.

<br/>

### Show Location:
With this action, a map shows up on the screen on which you can either show your current location on the map or you can show your specified coordinates on the map.

<br/>

The ACE action for Show Location is: `VivaAction.ShowLocation`. <br/>
It takes an optional location parameter: `locationCoordinates`. <br/>
To show a specific location, you should pass the location coordinates (latitude and longitude) via the `locationCoordinates` parameter. <br/>

The `locationCoordinates` object consists of the following properties:
```json
{
  /**
   * Latitude of the location.
   */
  latitude: number;

  /**
   * Longitude of the location.
   */
  longitude: number;

  /**
   * Timestamp
   */
  timestamp?: number;

  /**
   * Accuracy of the location.
   */
  accuracy?: number;
}
```

<br/>

### Tutorial and Examples
You can take a look at `this` tutorial which goes over the step by step details of how you may invoke the geolocation actions.

The following examples describe the geolocation action and their purpose.

1. <b> Get user's current location </b>
<br/>
In your template JSON, introduce the following action:
    ```json
       "actions": [
          {
            type: 'VivaAction.GetLocation',
            id: 'Get Location'
          }
        ]
    ```
    When this action gets invoked, user's current geolocation is fetched and is passed to the Third Party Developer via the onAction callback.

<br/>

2. <b> Select location from a map </b>
<br/>
In your template JSON, introduce the following action:
    ```json
       "actions": [
          {
            type: 'VivaAction.GetLocation',
            id: 'Get Location',
            parameters: {chooseLocationOnMap: true}
          }
        ]
    ```
    When this action gets invoked, a map opens up and user gets to select and share the location of their choice. The selected location's coordinates are passed to the Third Party Developer via the onAction callback.

<br/>

3. <b> Display user's current location </b>
<br/>
In your template JSON, introduce the following action:
    ```json
       "actions": [{
          type: 'VivaAction.ShowLocation',
          id: 'Show Location'
        }]
    ```
    When this action gets invoked, a map opens up and user's current location coordinates are shown on it.

<br/>

4. <b> Display a specified location </b>
<br/>
In your template JSON, introduce the following action:
    ```json
       "actions": [{
          type: 'VivaAction.ShowLocation',
          id: 'Show Location',
          parameters: {
            locationCoordinates: {
              latitude: 28.6132039578389,
              longitude: 77.229488240066
            }
          }
        }]
    ```
    When this action gets invoked, a map opens up and it shows the location coordinates specified in the action.

<br/>

### Access geolocation actions via card-designer card's property pane
If you don't want to write code, but still wish to see how the geolocation actions work, then you can explore `this` tutorial which lets you create cards with geolocation actions via property pane.

<br/>

> [!NOTE]
> Theses geolocation actions can be added on the card view or the buttons of the card view or inside the quick view.

<br/>

### Permission and error codes
For the location APIs to work, the user has to grant the permission to access device's location.


  Error Code    | Error Description
  ------------- | -------------
  PermissionDenied  | User has denied the permission to access location
  InternalError | An unexpected error happened while invoking the location APIs
  HostNotSupported | The location action is being used in an unsupported environment
<br/>


### Callbacks for Card Developers
When the action `VivaAction.GetLocation` is invoked, then we pass the location coordinates via the onAction callback.
> [!NOTE]
> onAction callback is not invoked for `VivaAction.ShowLocation`.

For actions: `VivaAction.GetLocation` and `VivaAction.ShowLocation`, if the user lands into an error state, then an onError callback will get invoked, to which we pass the action name and the error code.

<br/>

### Availability of geolocation actions
<br/>

> [!NOTE]
> These new actions are **only available in the browser** currently. Viva Connections desktop and Viva Connections mobile support will be enabled later.
After General Availability the support matrix for actions will look like:

  Action       | Viva Connection Desktop | Viva Connections Mobile | Browser
  ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
  Get Location  | Not Supported | Supported | Supported
  Show Location | Not Supported | Supported | Supported
